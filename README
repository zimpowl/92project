Resume :
[V.0.5] 
  -creation of an ast tree thanks to a struct tree. The size of the tree
  represent the number of his sons. We fill recursively the tree thanks to 
  the different rules of the grammar. 
  Once the ast is filled, the ast_reader read the
  tree recursively and call the differentes functions and builtins.
  
[V.0.8]
  -You can add some assignment word filled in a btree. When the word is 
  assigned, you can interpret it in a different condition such as 
  a while, a for or an until function. The beggining of some builtins are done
  like echo or cd. The test suits has been improved to have the compare the
  exact value between our 42shell with the bash posix. A new dot file has been 
  created to show us the grammar and the construction of our ast tree.
