Resume :
  creation of an ast tree thanks to a struct tree. The size of the tree
  represent the number of his sons. We fill recursively the tree thanks to 
  the different rules of ast. Once the ast is filled, the ast_reader read the
  tree recursively and call the differentes functions and builtins.
